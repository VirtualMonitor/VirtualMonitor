/** @defgroup grp_pdm_interfaces    The PDM Interface Definitions
 * @ingroup grp_pdm
 *
 * For historical reasons (the PDMINTERFACE enum) a lot of interface was stuffed
 * together in this group instead, dragging stuff into global space that didn't
 * need to be there and making this file huge (>2500 lines).  Since we're using
 * UUIDs as interface identifiers (IIDs) now, no only generic PDM interface will
 * be added to this file.  Component specific interface should be defined in the
 * header file of that component.
 *
 * Interfaces consists of a method table (typedef'ed struct) and an interface
 * ID.  The typename of the method table should have an 'I' in it, be all
 * capitals and according to the rules, no underscores.  The interface ID is a
 * \#define constructed by appending '_IID' to the typename. The IID value is a
 * UUID string on the form "a2299c0d-b709-4551-aa5a-73f59ffbed74".  If you stick
 * to these rules, you can make use of the PDMIBASE_QUERY_INTERFACE and
 * PDMIBASE_RETURN_INTERFACE when querying interface and implementing
 * PDMIBASE::pfnQueryInterface respectively.
 *
 * In most interface descriptions the orientation of the interface is given as
 * 'down' or 'up'.  This refers to a model with the device on the top and the
 * drivers stacked below it.  Sometimes there is mention of 'main' or 'external'
 * which normally means the same, i.e. the Main or VBoxBFE API.  Picture the
 * orientation of 'main' as horizontal.
